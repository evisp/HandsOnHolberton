### String Fundamentals in Python

This set of tasks is focused solely on string manipulation, using operations like indexing, slicing, and other key string methods.

#### 1. **Extracting Domain from Email**
   - **Objective:** Use string slicing and indexing to extract parts of an email address.
   - **Task:** Write a program that takes an email address as input and extracts the domain (the part after the `@` symbol). Print only the domain.
   - **Example Output:**
     ```
     Enter your email: john.doe@example.com
     Domain: example.com
     ```

#### 2. **Reversing Words in a Sentence**
   - **Objective:** Use string slicing and indexing to reverse the words in a sentence without using loops.
   - **Task:** Ask the user for a sentence and reverse the order of the words. For simplicity, consider a sentence with only two words.
   - **Example Output:**
     ```
     Enter a sentence: Holberton School
     Reversed sentence: School Holberton
     ```

#### 3. **Trimming Extra Spaces from a Sentence**
   - **Objective:** Use string methods to remove leading and trailing spaces.
   - **Task:** Write a program that takes a sentence with extra spaces at the beginning and end, then prints the sentence without those spaces.
   - **Example Output:**
     ```
     Enter a sentence:    Python is awesome!    
     Trimmed sentence: Python is awesome!
     ```

#### 4. **Extracting a Substring from a Sentence**
   - **Objective:** Use string slicing to extract a part of a sentence.
   - **Task:** Ask the user to enter a sentence, and then extract the substring starting from the 5th character up to the 10th character. Print the substring.
   - **Example Output:**
     ```
     Enter a sentence: Python programming is fun.
     Substring: on pr
     ```

#### 5. **Find and Replace a Word**
   - **Objective:** Use string methods to search and replace a word within a sentence.
   - **Task:** Write a program that asks for a sentence and replaces the word "bad" with "good", then prints the updated sentence.
   - **Example Output:**
     ```
     Enter a sentence: This is a bad example.
     Updated sentence: This is a good example.
     ```

#### 6. **Counting Occurrences of a Character**
   - **Objective:** Use string methods to count how many times a specific character appears in a string.
   - **Task:** Ask the user for a string and a character, then count how many times that character appears in the string and print the result.
   - **Example Output:**
     ```
     Enter a string: Holberton School
     Enter a character: o
     The character 'o' appears 2 times.
     ```

#### 7. **Finding the Position of a Substring**
   - **Objective:** Use string methods to find the index of a substring.
   - **Task:** Write a program that takes a sentence and a word, then prints the index of the first occurrence of that word in the sentence.
   - **Example Output:**
     ```
     Enter a sentence: Python programming is fun.
     Enter a word: programming
     The word 'programming' starts at index 7.
     ```
