### Python Programming Tasks: Working with Variables and Strings

This document contains a series of tasks designed to help students at Holberton School practice Python programming concepts, specifically focusing on variables, printing, and string manipulation. These tasks will help students develop foundational skills in Python, gradually progressing from simple printing to more complex string operations.

#### 3. **Basic Math Operations**
   - **Objective:** Using variables to store and print values.
   - **Task:** Create two variables for your age and your friend's age. Print both and also display the sum of your ages.
   - **Example Output:**
     ```
     My age: 25
     Friend's age: 24
     Total age: 49
     ```

#### 4. **Reverse a String**
   - **Objective:** Work with string manipulation.
   - **Task:** Ask the user for a string and print the reverse of that string.
   - **Example Output:**
     ```
     Enter a string: Hello
     Reversed string: olleH
     ```

#### 5. **Extract Substring**
   - **Objective:** Learn string slicing and manipulation.
   - **Task:** Ask the user for a sentence and print the first 6 characters of the string.
   - **Example Output:**
     ```
     Enter a sentence: Python is great!
     First 5 characters: Python
     ```

#### 6. **Concatenate Strings**
   - **Objective:** Learn to combine strings and variables.
   - **Task:** Create a program that asks for the user's first and last name, then prints their full name by concatenating both strings.
   - **Example Output:**
     ```
     Enter your first name: John
     Enter your last name: Doe
     Your full name is: John Doe
     ```

#### 7. **String Length**
   - **Objective:** Work with string properties.
   - **Task:** Ask the user to enter a word and print the length of that word.
   - **Example Output:**
     ```
     Enter a word: Holberton
     Length of the word: 10
     ```

#### 8. **Find Word in Sentence**
   - **Objective:** Practice searching within a string.
   - **Task:** Create a program that asks for a sentence and checks if the word "Python" exists in it. Print a message indicating whether the word is found.
   - **Example Output:**
     ```
     Enter a sentence: I love Python programming.
     Python is in the sentence!
     ```

#### 9. **Formatting Strings**
   - **Objective:** Practice formatting strings using variables.
   - **Task:** Ask the user for their age and print a message using string formatting that says: "You are [age] years old."
   - **Example Output:**
     ```
     Enter your age: 25
     You are 25 years old.
     ```

#### 10. **Uppercase and Lowercase**
   - **Objective:** Work with string case manipulation.
   - **Task:** Ask the user for a word and print both the uppercase and lowercase versions of that word.
   - **Example Output:**
     ```
     Enter a word: Python
     Uppercase: PYTHON
     Lowercase: python
     ```
