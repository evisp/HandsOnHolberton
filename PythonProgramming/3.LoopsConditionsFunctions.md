## Python Programming Tasks: Working with Functions, Loops, and Conditions

This document contains a series of tasks designed to help students at Holberton School practice Python programming concepts related to functions, loops, and conditions. The tasks are divided into two groupsâ€”one focused on mathematical operations and the other on user interaction tasks.

### **Group 1: Mathematical Operations**

These tasks focus on mathematical operations, such as checking if numbers are even or prime, generating Fibonacci sequences, and calculating factorials. Additionally, a menu-driven application is included to allow interaction with these functions.

#### 1. **Check if a Number is Even or Odd**
   - **Task:** Write a function `check_even_or_odd(number)` that takes a number and prints whether the number is "Even" or "Odd".
   - **Example Output:**
     ```
     Enter a number: 5
     Odd
     ```

#### 2. **Generate Fibonacci Sequence**
   - **Task:** Write a function `generate_fibonacci(n)` that generates the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence and prints them.
   - **Example Output:**
     ```
     The first 6 Fibonacci numbers are: 0 1 1 2 3 5
     ```

#### 3. **Calculate Factorial of a Number**
   - **Task:** Write a function `calculate_factorial(number)` that takes a number and returns its factorial.
   - **Example Output:**
     ```
     Enter a number: 5
     The factorial of 5 is: 120
     ```

#### 4. **Prime Number Checker**
   - **Task:** Write a function `is_prime(number)` that checks if a given number is a prime number. If the number is prime, print "Prime", otherwise print "Not prime".
   - **Example Output:**
     ```
     Enter a number: 7
     Prime
     ```

#### 5. **Calculate Sum of Even Numbers in a Range**
   - **Task:** Write a function `sum_of_evens(start, end)` that calculates the sum of all even numbers in a given range (from `start` to `end`).
   - **Example Output:**
     ```
     The sum of even numbers between 1 and 10 is: 30
     ```

#### 6. **Menu-Driven Program for Mathematical Operations**
   - **Task:** Create a menu-driven program that allows the user to choose between:
     - 1: Check if a number is Even or Odd
     - 2: Generate Fibonacci Sequence
     - 3: Calculate Factorial of a Number
     - 4: Check if a Number is Prime
     - 5: Calculate Sum of Even Numbers in a Range
     - 6: Exit
     - The program should continue running until the user chooses to exit. The program should prompt the user to enter relevant input for each option.
   - **Example Output:**
     ```
     1. Check Even/Odd
     2. Generate Fibonacci
     3. Calculate Factorial
     4. Prime Check
     5. Sum of Even Numbers
     6. Exit
     Choose an option: 2
     Enter the number of Fibonacci numbers to generate: 5
     The first 5 Fibonacci numbers are: 0 1 1 2 3
     ```

### **Group 2: User Interaction**

These tasks involve interacting with the user, such as greeting, checking passwords, and generating random passwords, all using functions, loops, and conditions.

#### 1. **Greet the User**
   - **Task:** Write a function `greet_user(name)` that takes a user's name as input and prints a greeting message: "Hello, [name]!".
   - **Example Output:**
     ```
     Enter your name: Alice
     Hello, Alice!
     ```

#### 2. **Password Check**
   - **Task:** Write a function `check_password(password)` that checks if the password is "admin123". If it is, print "Password correct", otherwise print "Incorrect password".
   - **Example Output:**
     ```
     Enter your password: admin123
     Password correct
     ```

#### 3. **Generate a Random Password**
   - **Task:** Write a function `generate_password(length)` that generates a random password of a given length using letters and digits.
   - **Example Output:**
     ```
     Your randomly generated password is: h9fJ7z8B
     ```

#### 4. **Login System with Multiple Attempts**
   - **Task:** Write a function `login_system(username, password)` that checks if the username is "admin" and the password is "1234". Allow the user up to 3 attempts to enter the correct login details.
   - **Example Output:**
     ```
     Enter username: admin
     Enter password: 1234
     Login successful!
     ```

#### 5. **Menu-Driven Program for User Interaction**
   - **Task:** Create a menu-driven program that allows the user to choose between:
     - 1: Greet User
     - 2: Password Check
     - 3: Generate Random Password
     - 4: Exit
     - The program should continue running until the user chooses to exit.
   - **Example Output:**
     ```
     1. Greet User
     2. Password Check
     3. Generate Random Password
     4. Exit
     Choose an option: 1
     Enter your name: Alice
     Hello, Alice!
     ```
