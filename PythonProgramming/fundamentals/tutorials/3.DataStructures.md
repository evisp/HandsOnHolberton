# **Data Structures in Python: Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries**

### **1. Lists**

#### **Idea**:
A **list** is an ordered collection of items. It’s mutable, meaning you can change, add, or remove items after the list is created. Lists are one of the most versatile and frequently used data structures in Python.

#### **Real-World Use Case**:
Imagine you’re working on a **bookstore inventory system**. You want to keep track of the books in the store, and this list might change over time as books are added or sold.

#### **Structure & Syntax**:
- **Syntax**: A list is created by placing items inside square brackets `[]`.
- **Mutable**: You can modify the list after it’s created.
- **Indexed**: Items in the list are ordered, and each item can be accessed using its index (starting from 0).

#### **Example**:
Let’s build a simple bookstore inventory system using a list:

```python
# List of books in the bookstore (just titles for simplicity)
bookstore_inventory = ["Python Basics", "Data Science Handbook", "Machine Learning for Beginners"]

# Adding a new book
bookstore_inventory.append("AI for Everyone")

# Removing a book
bookstore_inventory.remove("Python Basics")

# Displaying the updated list of books
print("Updated Bookstore Inventory:")
for book in bookstore_inventory:
    print(book)
```

**Explanation**:
- We created a list of books in the bookstore.
- We added a new book using `append()` and removed an old one using `remove()`.
- We used a `for` loop to display all books in the inventory.



### **Key Methods in Lists**

Let's now go deeper into **key methods** in Python lists, with explanations and examples.

Lists in Python come with a variety of built-in methods that allow you to manipulate and interact with the list's data. Here are some of the most commonly used methods:

---

#### **1. append()**
- **Purpose**: Adds a new item to the end of the list.
- **Use Case**: You can use `append()` when you want to add new items to a list without worrying about the position, as it will always add the item to the end.

```python
# Adding a new book to the bookstore inventory
bookstore_inventory.append("AI for Everyone")
print(bookstore_inventory)
```
- **Result**: The list will now have "AI for Everyone" added at the end.

---

#### **2. remove()**
- **Purpose**: Removes the first occurrence of a specified item from the list.
- **Use Case**: `remove()` is helpful when you know the exact item you want to delete, and you want to remove it from the list.

```python
# Removing a book by its name
bookstore_inventory.remove("Python Basics")
print(bookstore_inventory)
```
- **Result**: "Python Basics" is removed from the list.

---

#### **3. pop()**
- **Purpose**: Removes and returns the item at a specific index. If no index is provided, it removes and returns the last item.
- **Use Case**: Use `pop()` when you want to remove an item from a specific index and also need to use the value that was removed.

```python
# Popping the last book from the inventory
removed_book = bookstore_inventory.pop()
print("Removed Book:", removed_book)
print("Updated Inventory:", bookstore_inventory)
```
- **Result**: The last book is removed and stored in the variable `removed_book`.

---

#### **4. insert()**
- **Purpose**: Inserts an item at a specific index in the list. The item will be shifted to the right.
- **Use Case**: Use `insert()` when you need to place an item in a specific position rather than at the end.

```python
# Inserting a book at the beginning of the list
bookstore_inventory.insert(0, "Introduction to AI")
print(bookstore_inventory)
```
- **Result**: "Introduction to AI" will be added to the beginning of the list (index 0).

---

#### **5. sort()**
- **Purpose**: Sorts the list in ascending order (by default). You can use `reverse=True` to sort in descending order.
- **Use Case**: Use `sort()` when you want to arrange items in a specific order (alphabetically, numerically, etc.).

```python
# Sorting the bookstore inventory in alphabetical order
bookstore_inventory.sort()
print(bookstore_inventory)
```
- **Result**: The books will be sorted alphabetically in ascending order.

---

#### **6. reverse()**
- **Purpose**: Reverses the order of items in the list.
- **Use Case**: Use `reverse()` when you want to change the order of the items in the list.

```python
# Reversing the order of the inventory
bookstore_inventory.reverse()
print(bookstore_inventory)
```
- **Result**: The list will be reversed, showing books from last to first.

---

#### **7. extend()**
- **Purpose**: Adds all elements from another iterable (like a list or tuple) to the end of the current list.
- **Use Case**: Use `extend()` to combine two lists or add multiple items to a list in one operation.

```python
# Extending the list with new books
new_books = ["Deep Learning", "Data Engineering", "Big Data Analysis"]
bookstore_inventory.extend(new_books)
print(bookstore_inventory)
```
- **Result**: The new books are added to the end of the existing list.

---

#### **8. count()**
- **Purpose**: Returns the number of times a specified item appears in the list.
- **Use Case**: Use `count()` to check how many times an item appears in the list.

```python
# Counting how many times a book appears
book_count = bookstore_inventory.count("Machine Learning for Beginners")
print(f"'Machine Learning for Beginners' appears {book_count} times.")
```
- **Result**: It will return the number of times "Machine Learning for Beginners" appears in the list.

---

#### **9. index()**
- **Purpose**: Returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified item.
- **Use Case**: Use `index()` when you need to find the position of an item in the list.

```python
# Finding the index of a book
book_index = bookstore_inventory.index("Data Science Handbook")
print(f"'Data Science Handbook' is at index {book_index}.")
```
- **Result**: It will return the index where "Data Science Handbook" is located in the list.

---

### **Example: Using Methods in the Bookstore Inventory**

Let’s integrate the methods we discussed into our **bookstore inventory system**:

```python
# List of books in the bookstore
bookstore_inventory = ["Python Basics", "Data Science Handbook", "Machine Learning for Beginners"]

# 1. Adding a new book
bookstore_inventory.append("AI for Everyone")

# 2. Removing a book
bookstore_inventory.remove("Python Basics")

# 3. Popping the last book
removed_book = bookstore_inventory.pop()
print(f"Removed Book: {removed_book}")

# 4. Inserting a book at the beginning
bookstore_inventory.insert(0, "Introduction to AI")

# 5. Sorting the books
bookstore_inventory.sort()

# 6. Reversing the order of books
bookstore_inventory.reverse()

# 7. Extending with more books
new_books = ["Deep Learning", "Data Engineering", "Big Data Analysis"]
bookstore_inventory.extend(new_books)

# 8. Counting occurrences of a book
book_count = bookstore_inventory.count("Deep Learning")
print(f"'Deep Learning' appears {book_count} times.")

# 9. Finding the index of a book
book_index = bookstore_inventory.index("Data Science Handbook")
print(f"'Data Science Handbook' is at index {book_index}.")

# Displaying the final inventory
print("\nFinal Bookstore Inventory:")
for book in bookstore_inventory:
    print(book)
```

---

### **Key Points**

Here’s a summary of the methods we covered:

- **append()**: Adds an item to the end.
- **remove()**: Removes a specific item by value.
- **pop()**: Removes and returns an item at a specific index (or the last item).
- **insert()**: Inserts an item at a specific position.
- **sort()**: Sorts the list in ascending order.
- **reverse()**: Reverses the list order.
- **extend()**: Adds multiple items to the end of the list.
- **count()**: Returns the number of times an item appears.
- **index()**: Returns the index of the first occurrence of an item.

### **2. Tuples**

#### **Idea**:
A **tuple** is very similar to a list but with one key difference: it is **immutable**, meaning you cannot change its elements once it’s created. Tuples are generally used to store data that shouldn't be modified.

#### **Real-World Use Case**:
Imagine you’re developing a **GPS navigation app**. The latitude and longitude of a location should not change, so you can store these as a tuple.

#### **Structure & Syntax**:
- **Syntax**: A tuple is created by placing items inside parentheses `()`.
- **Immutable**: Once a tuple is created, it cannot be changed.
- **Indexed**: Like lists, tuples are ordered, and you can access elements by their index.

#### **Example**:
Let’s simulate storing coordinates of popular locations in a city using tuples:

```python
# Tuple of coordinates (latitude, longitude) for different landmarks
landmark_coordinates = (
    ("Statue of Liberty", (40.6892, -74.0445)),
    ("Central Park", (40.7851, -73.9683)),
    ("Empire State Building", (40.748817, -73.985428))
)

# Displaying coordinates of each landmark
for landmark, coordinates in landmark_coordinates:
    print(f"Landmark: {landmark}, Coordinates: {coordinates}")
```

**Explanation**:
- We created a tuple where each item holds a tuple of a landmark and its coordinates.
- Tuples are useful for fixed data, and here, the coordinates will not change.
- We used a `for` loop to print each landmark and its corresponding coordinates.

---

### **3. Sets**

#### **Idea**:
A **set** is an unordered collection of unique items. It automatically removes duplicates, making it perfect for situations where you need to track unique items and don’t care about their order.

#### **Real-World Use Case**:
Let’s say you’re working on a **social media app** and you want to track the unique tags that a user has used in their posts.

#### **Structure & Syntax**:
- **Syntax**: A set is created by placing items inside curly braces `{}`.
- **No Duplicates**: Sets automatically discard duplicate values.
- **Unordered**: Sets do not guarantee the order of elements.

#### **Example**:
Let’s track the unique hashtags used by a user:

```python
# Set of unique hashtags a user has used
user_hashtags = {"#python", "#data", "#machinelearning", "#python"}

# Adding a new hashtag
user_hashtags.add("#ai")

# Try adding a duplicate (won't work, as sets ignore duplicates)
user_hashtags.add("#python")

# Displaying unique hashtags
print("Unique Hashtags Used by User:")
for hashtag in user_hashtags:
    print(hashtag)
```

**Explanation**:
- We created a set of hashtags where duplicates are automatically removed.
- We added a new hashtag using `add()`, and we tried to add a duplicate (`#python`), but it was ignored because sets don’t allow duplicates.
- We printed out the unique hashtags used by the user.

### **4. Dictionaries**

#### **Idea**:
A **dictionary** is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique, and it maps to a value. Dictionaries are ideal for scenarios where you need to associate a unique identifier with data.

#### **Real-World Use Case**:
In a **library management system**, you can use a dictionary to store information about books, where the book ID (the unique identifier) is the key, and the book's details (such as title, author, and availability) are the values.

#### **Structure & Syntax**:
- **Syntax**: A dictionary is created by placing key-value pairs inside curly braces `{}`.
- **Key-Value Pairs**: Each key maps to a value.
- **Unordered**: Dictionaries do not guarantee the order of elements.

#### **Example**:
Let’s simulate a library system where books are stored by their ID:

```python
# Dictionary of books, with book ID as the key
library_books = {
    1: {"title": "Python Basics", "author": "John Doe", "available": True},
    2: {"title": "Data Science Handbook", "author": "Jane Smith", "available": False},
    3: {"title": "Machine Learning for Beginners", "author": "Alice Brown", "available": True}
}

# Accessing details of a book using its ID
book_id = 1
book = library_books[book_id]
print(f"Book ID: {book_id}, Title: {book['title']}, Author: {book['author']}, Available: {book['available']}")

# Updating availability of a book
library_books[2]["available"] = True
print(f"Updated Availability of 'Data Science Handbook': {library_books[2]['available']}")
```

**Explanation**:
- We created a dictionary where each book's ID is the key, and the value is another dictionary containing the book's details.
- We accessed the details of a book using its ID (key).
- We updated the availability of a book, simulating a change in the library’s inventory.


### **Key Methods in Python Dictionaries**

Now let's go deeper into some **key methods** that are used in Python dictionaries. These methods allow you to perform operations such as adding, removing, and updating items in the dictionary, as well as checking for the presence of specific keys or values.

---

#### **1. `get()`**
- **Purpose**: Returns the value associated with a given key. If the key does not exist, it returns `None` or a specified default value instead of raising an error.
- **Use Case**: Use `get()` when you want to access a value but don't want your program to crash if the key does not exist.

```python
# Accessing a book’s title using `get()`
book_title = library_books.get(1, {}).get("title", "Title not found")
print(f"Book Title: {book_title}")
```
- **Result**: If the key `1` exists, it will return the book title; otherwise, it will return `"Title not found"`.

---

#### **2. `keys()`**
- **Purpose**: Returns a view of all the keys in the dictionary.
- **Use Case**: Use `keys()` when you need to iterate over all the keys in the dictionary, such as displaying all book IDs.

```python
# Getting all book IDs
book_ids = library_books.keys()
print(f"Book IDs: {book_ids}")
```
- **Result**: This will display a view object of the dictionary keys, which in this case will be the book IDs.

---

#### **3. `values()`**
- **Purpose**: Returns a view of all the values in the dictionary.
- **Use Case**: Use `values()` when you want to extract all the values (e.g., all book details) from the dictionary.

```python
# Getting all book details (values)
book_details = library_books.values()
print(f"Book Details: {book_details}")
```
- **Result**: This will return a view of the values (i.e., the details of the books).

---

#### **4. `items()`**
- **Purpose**: Returns a view of all key-value pairs in the dictionary, each represented as a tuple `(key, value)`.
- **Use Case**: Use `items()` when you need both the key and the value to perform an operation, such as displaying each book's details.

```python
# Displaying all books with their details
for book_id, details in library_books.items():
    print(f"Book ID: {book_id}, Title: {details['title']}, Author: {details['author']}, Available: {details['available']}")
```
- **Result**: This will iterate over the dictionary and print the book ID along with its details.

---

#### **5. `update()`**
- **Purpose**: Updates the dictionary with key-value pairs from another dictionary or iterable. If a key already exists, its value is updated; otherwise, a new key-value pair is added.
- **Use Case**: Use `update()` when you want to update multiple items at once or merge another dictionary into the current one.

```python
# Updating a book's details using `update()`
new_book_info = {4: {"title": "Deep Learning", "author": "Sarah Lee", "available": True}}
library_books.update(new_book_info)
print(f"Updated Library: {library_books}")
```
- **Result**: This will add a new book to the library with the ID `4` and its respective details.

---

#### **6. `pop()`**
- **Purpose**: Removes and returns the value associated with a given key. If the key doesn’t exist, it raises a `KeyError`, unless a default value is provided.
- **Use Case**: Use `pop()` when you need to remove an item and also want to retrieve the value of the removed item.

```python
# Removing a book by its ID using `pop()`
removed_book = library_books.pop(2, None)  # Removes book with ID 2
print(f"Removed Book: {removed_book}")
print(f"Library after removal: {library_books}")
```
- **Result**: The book with ID `2` is removed from the dictionary and stored in `removed_book`.

---

#### **7. `popitem()`**
- **Purpose**: Removes and returns the last key-value pair in the dictionary. This method works with **unordered** dictionaries, so the "last" item is the most recently added item.
- **Use Case**: Use `popitem()` when you need to remove the most recently added item in the dictionary.

```python
# Removing the last book added using `popitem()`
last_added_book = library_books.popitem()
print(f"Last Added Book: {last_added_book}")
print(f"Library after removal: {library_books}")
```
- **Result**: This will remove and display the most recently added key-value pair in the dictionary.

---

#### **8. `clear()`**
- **Purpose**: Removes all items from the dictionary, making it empty.
- **Use Case**: Use `clear()` when you want to reset the dictionary and remove all the data.

```python
# Clearing all books in the library
library_books.clear()
print(f"Library after clearing: {library_books}")
```
- **Result**: This will empty the `library_books` dictionary.

---

#### **9. `setdefault()`**
- **Purpose**: Returns the value associated with a key. If the key does not exist, it adds the key with a specified default value.
- **Use Case**: Use `setdefault()` when you want to ensure a key exists in the dictionary with a default value.

```python
# Using `setdefault()` to ensure a book exists in the library with a default value
book_details = library_books.setdefault(5, {"title": "AI in Practice", "author": "Tom Green", "available": True})
print(f"Book Details for ID 5: {book_details}")
```
- **Result**: If book ID `5` doesn't exist, it will be added with the specified details.

---

### **Example: Using Methods in the Library System**

Let’s integrate these methods into our **library management system**:

```python
# Dictionary of books in the library
library_books = {
    1: {"title": "Python Basics", "author": "John Doe", "available": True},
    2: {"title": "Data Science Handbook", "author": "Jane Smith", "available": False},
    3: {"title": "Machine Learning for Beginners", "author": "Alice Brown", "available": True}
}

# 1. Using get() to access book details
book_title = library_books.get(1, {}).get("title", "Not found")
print(f"Book Title: {book_title}")

# 2. Using keys() to list all book IDs
print(f"Book IDs: {library_books.keys()}")

# 3. Using values() to list all book details
print(f"Book Details: {library_books.values()}")

# 4. Using items() to display all books
for book_id, details in library_books.items():
    print(f"Book ID: {book_id}, Title: {details['title']}")

# 5. Using update() to add a new book
new_book_info = {4: {"title": "AI for Beginners", "author": "Mike Johnson", "available": True}}
library_books.update(new_book_info)

# 6. Using pop() to remove a book by ID
removed_book = library_books.pop(2, None)
print(f"Removed Book: {removed_book}")

# 7. Using popitem() to remove and return the last added book
last_added_book = library_books.popitem()
print(f"Last Added Book: {last_added_book}")

# 8. Using clear() to empty the library
library_books.clear()
print(f"Library after clearing: {library_books}")
```

---

### **Key points**

In summary, dictionaries in Python are powerful data structures for storing and accessing data using **key-value pairs**. With these key methods:

- **get()**: Retrieve a value with a default if the key doesn't exist.
- **keys()**: Get all keys in the dictionary.
- **values()**: Get all values in the dictionary.
- **items()**: Get all key-value pairs.
- **update()**: Add or modify multiple items.
- **pop()**: Remove and return an item by key.
- **popitem()**: Remove and return the last item.
- **clear()**: Remove all items.
- **setdefault()**: Ensure a key exists with a default value.

---

### **Combining Data Structures**

Now that we've understood the individual data structures, let’s look at how they can be combined. For instance, we could store a **list of dictionaries**, where each dictionary represents a book in a bookstore and includes a **set** of tags for each book.

#### **Example**:

```python
# List of books, where each book is represented by a dictionary
bookstore_inventory = [
    {"title": "Python Basics", "author": "John Doe", "tags": {"python", "programming", "beginners"}},
    {"title": "Data Science Handbook", "author": "Jane Smith", "tags": {"data science", "python", "analytics"}},
    {"title": "Machine Learning for Beginners", "author": "Alice Brown", "tags": {"machine learning", "ai", "python"}}
]

# Adding a new book to the list
bookstore_inventory.append({"title": "Advanced AI", "author": "Mark Lee", "tags": {"ai", "advanced", "machine learning"}})

# Displaying all books and their tags
for book in bookstore_inventory:
    print(f"Title: {book['title']}, Author: {book['author']}, Tags: {', '.join(book['tags'])}")
```

**Explanation**:
- We created a **list** of dictionaries. Each dictionary contains details about a book, including a **set** of tags associated with the book.
- We added a new book to the list, and we printed the title, author, and tags of each book.

---

### **Summary of When to Use Each Data Structure**:

- **Lists**: Use when you need an ordered collection that might change (e.g., storing a list of books in an inventory).
- **Tuples**: Use when you need an ordered collection of data that should remain constant (e.g., storing coordinates).
- **Sets**: Use when you need to track unique items (e.g., tags or user IDs in social media).
- **Dictionaries**: Use when you need to associate a unique key with specific data (e.g., storing book details by their ID).

By combining these structures, you can organize and manage data more effectively in real-world applications.
