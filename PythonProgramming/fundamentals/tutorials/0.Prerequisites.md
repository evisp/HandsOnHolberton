## **Python Functions**

In this tutorial, we will cover some key concepts of functions in Python and then walk through building a simple calculator. This approach will help you understand how to use functions, pass arguments, return values, and combine everything into a complete program. The goal is for you to learn through building a hands-on project.

### **Key Concepts: Functions in Python**

#### **What is a Function?**

A function is a block of code designed to do one specific task. Functions allow us to organize our code into reusable pieces, making it cleaner, more efficient, and easier to understand.

Functions in Python are defined using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses. The code inside the function is indented to indicate it belongs to that function.

#### **Syntax of a Function**

```python
def function_name(parameters):
    # code block
    return value  # optional
```

1. **Function Definition**: Functions are defined using `def`, followed by the function name and parameters (optional).
2. **Parameters**: These are the values you pass into the function, which the function will use to perform its task.
3. **Return Value**: A function can return a value after performing its task. The `return` keyword is used to send the result back to where the function was called.

#### **Why Use Functions?**
- **Reusability**: Write a piece of code once and use it whenever you need it.
- **Readability**: Break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable tasks.
- **Organization**: Keep your code clean by grouping related code together.

### **Example 1: A Simple Addition Function**

We’ll start by creating a simple function that adds two numbers.

#### **Code:**

```python
def add(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2
```

#### **Explanation:**

1. **Function Definition**: 
   - The function is named `add`.
   - It takes **two parameters**, `num1` and `num2`, which are the values the function will use in its calculation.

2. **Parameters**: 
   - `num1` and `num2` are the parameters, representing the two numbers we want to add.

3. **Return Value**: 
   - The function **returns** the result of `num1 + num2`. This result is the sum of the two input numbers.

#### **Example Usage:**

```python
result = add(5, 3)
print(result) 
```

In this example, `add(5, 3)` calls the function, and the return value `8` is stored in the `result` variable and printed.

### **Example 2: A Function to Check if a Number is Even or Odd**

Now let's create a function that checks whether a given number is even or odd.

#### **Code:**

```python
def is_even(number):
    if number % 2 == 0:
        return True  
    else:
        return False  
```

#### **Explanation:**

1. **Function Definition**: 
   - The function is named `is_even`, and it takes one parameter, `number`, which is the number to check.

2. **Parameters**: 
   - The function only needs one input, the number to check.

3. **Return Value**: 
   - The function returns a **boolean** (`True` or `False`), indicating whether the number is even or odd.

#### **Example Usage:**

```python
result = is_even(10)
print(result)  

result = is_even(7)
print(result)  
```

In this example, `is_even(10)` returns `True`, and `is_even(7)` returns `False`.

### **Example 3: A Function to Calculate the Area of a Rectangle**

Let's create a function that calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width.

#### **Code:**

```python
def calculate_area(length, width):
    return length * width
```

#### **Explanation:**

1. **Function Definition**: 
   - The function is named `calculate_area` and takes two parameters: `length` and `width`.

2. **Parameters**: 
   - `length` and `width` represent the dimensions of the rectangle.

3. **Return Value**: 
   - The function calculates the area by multiplying the `length` by the `width` and returns the result.

#### **Example Usage:**

```python
area = calculate_area(5, 3)
print(area)  
```

Here, `calculate_area(5, 3)` returns `15` because the area of a rectangle with length 5 and width 3 is 15.

### **Building a Simple Calculator - Hands-on Workshop**

Now that we have a basic understanding of functions, let’s build a simple calculator step by step. This calculator will allow users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. As we go along, we’ll enhance the calculator with more complex features.

---

### **Step 1: Start with Basic Arithmetic Operations**

We'll begin by creating separate functions for each arithmetic operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each function will take two numbers as arguments and return the result.

```python
# Function to add two numbers
def add(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2

# Function to subtract two numbers
def subtract(num1, num2):
    return num1 - num2

# Function to multiply two numbers
def multiply(num1, num2):
    return num1 * num2

# Function to divide two numbers
def divide(num1, num2):
    if num2 == 0:
        return "Error! Division by zero."
    else:
        return num1 / num2
```

In this part:
- We define four simple functions: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`.
- Each function accepts two arguments (the numbers to operate on) and returns the result.
- The division function handles the case of dividing by zero and returns an error message instead of causing a crash.

### **Step 2: Building the Menu-Driven Interface**

Now that we have the core arithmetic functions, we need a way for the user to interact with our calculator. We will create a menu where the user can choose the operation they want to perform.

#### **Creating the Menu Function**

We will create a function called `display_menu()` to display the available operations to the user. 

```python
# Function to display the menu
def display_menu():
    print("Simple Calculator")
    print("1. Add")
    print("2. Subtract")
    print("3. Multiply")
    print("4. Divide")
    print("5. Exit")
```

The `display_menu()` function simply prints out a list of operations that the user can choose from. Each operation is numbered from 1 to 5.

---

### **Step 3: Getting User Input**

Now, we need a way to collect numbers from the user. We'll create a function called `get_numbers()` that will ask the user for two numbers and return them.

```python
# Function to get user input for numbers
def get_numbers():
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
    num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
    return num1, num2
```

In the `get_numbers()` function:
- We prompt the user to input two numbers.
- We use `float()` to ensure the numbers can be decimal (not just integers).
- We return both numbers so that they can be used in our arithmetic functions.

---

### **Step 4: Main Program with Loop and Menu**

Now that we have the basic components, let’s put everything together. We’ll create the `main()` function, which will display the menu, take user input, and call the appropriate operation based on the user's choice.

```python
# Main function to control the flow of the program
def main():
    while True:
        display_menu()
        choice = input("Select an operation (1/2/3/4/5): ")

        if choice == "1":
            num1, num2 = get_numbers()
            print(f"The result is: {add(num1, num2)}")
        elif choice == "2":
            num1, num2 = get_numbers()
            print(f"The result is: {subtract(num1, num2)}")
        elif choice == "3":
            num1, num2 = get_numbers()
            print(f"The result is: {multiply(num1, num2)}")
        elif choice == "4":
            num1, num2 = get_numbers()
            print(f"The result is: {divide(num1, num2)}")
        elif choice == "5":
            print("Exiting the calculator. Goodbye!")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice, please try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Main Program Loop**:
   - The program runs in an infinite loop until the user selects the option to exit (option 5).
   - The `display_menu()` function shows the options.
   - The user selects an option, and the corresponding operation is performed based on the user’s choice.

2. **Input Validation**:
   - We use `if-elif-else` statements to determine which operation to perform based on the user’s input.
   - If the input is invalid (anything other than 1-5), the program will prompt the user to try again.

3. **Exit Condition**:
   - If the user selects option "5", the program will exit the loop and print a goodbye message.

---

### **Step 5: Enhancing the Calculator with More Features**

Now, let’s enhance our calculator by adding some more advanced features, such as calculating square roots and powers.

#### **Adding New Operations: Square Root and Power**

We’ll add two new functions:
1. **Square Root**: This will take a single number and return its square root.
2. **Power**: This will take two numbers and return the first number raised to the power of the second.

```python
import math

# Function to calculate square root
def square_root(num):
    return math.sqrt(num)

# Function to calculate the power of a number
def power(num1, num2):
    return num1 ** num2
```

#### **Updating the Menu with New Options**

Now, we’ll update the menu to include options for these new operations:

```python
# Updated function to display the menu
def display_menu():
    print("Simple Calculator")
    print("1. Add")
    print("2. Subtract")
    print("3. Multiply")
    print("4. Divide")
    print("5. Square Root")
    print("6. Power")
    print("7. Exit")
```

#### **Handling New Operations in the Main Program**

Lastly, we need to update the `main()` function to handle these new operations.

```python
# Main function to control the flow of the program
def main():
    while True:
        display_menu()
        choice = input("Select an operation (1/2/3/4/5/6/7): ")

        if choice == "1":
            num1, num2 = get_numbers()
            print(f"The result is: {add(num1, num2)}")
        elif choice == "2":
            num1, num2 = get_numbers()
            print(f"The result is: {subtract(num1, num2)}")
        elif choice == "3":
            num1, num2 = get_numbers()
            print(f"The result is: {multiply(num1, num2)}")
        elif choice == "4":
            num1, num2 = get_numbers()
            print(f"The result is: {divide(num1, num2)}")
        elif choice == "5":
            num = float(input("Enter the number for square root: "))
            print(f"The result is: {square_root(num)}")
        elif choice == "6":
            num1, num2 = get_numbers()
            print(f"The result is: {power(num1, num2)}")
        elif choice == "7":
            print("Exiting the calculator. Goodbye!")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice, please try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Now the calculator has additional features like square root and power, giving the user more flexibility in the operations they can perform.
