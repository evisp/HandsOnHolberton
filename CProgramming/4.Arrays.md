### C Programming: Functions with Arrays

This document provides a set of exercises that practice using functions and array manipulation. Each task involves writing a function that works with arrays, designed to help beginners understand how to handle arrays in C step by step.

#### Task 1: Initialize and Print an Array
- Write a function called `printArray` that takes an integer array and its size as parameters and prints all the elements of the array.
- **Hint**: Use a `for` loop to access each element of the array.

#### Task 2: Find the Largest Element in an Array
- Write a function `findLargest` that takes an integer array and its size as parameters and returns the largest element in the array.
- **Hint**: Use a `for` loop and a variable to track the largest number while iterating through the array.

#### Task 3: Sum of Array Elements
- Write a function `sumArray` that takes an integer array and its size as parameters and returns the sum of all the elements in the array.
- **Hint**: Initialize a `sum` variable to 0, and add each element of the array to it using a loop.

#### Task 4: Count Occurrences of a Value in an Array
- Write a function `countOccurrences` that takes an integer array, its size, and a target value as parameters and returns the count of how many times the target value appears in the array.
- **Hint**: Use a `for` loop to iterate through the array, and a counter variable to count the occurrences.

#### Task 5: Reverse an Array
- Write a function `reverseArray` that takes an integer array and its size as parameters and reverses the elements of the array in place.
- **Hint**: Swap elements from the start and end of the array using a loop.

#### Task 6: Array of Strings - Print a List of Names
- Write a function `printNames` that takes an array of strings and its size as parameters and prints each name on a new line.
- **Hint**: Use a loop to iterate through the array of strings and print each one.

#### Task 7: Find the Average of Array Elements
- Write a function `findAverage` that takes an integer array and its size as parameters and returns the average of the elements in the array.
- **Hint**: Add all the elements of the array and divide by the number of elements in the array.

#### Task 8: Check if an Array is Sorted in Ascending Order
- Write a function `isSorted` that takes an integer array and its size as parameters and returns `1` if the array is sorted in ascending order, otherwise returns `0`.
- **Hint**: Compare each element with the next element using a loop. If any element is greater than the next, the array is not sorted.

#### Task 9 (Challenge): Matrix Multiplication
- Write a function `multiplyMatrices` that takes two 2x2 matrices and stores the resulting matrix in a third matrix. The function should print the resulting matrix.
- **Hint**: Use two nested loops to multiply corresponding elements and sum them to create the resulting matrix.

#### Task 10: Remove Duplicates from an Array
- Write a function `removeDuplicates` that takes an integer array and its size as parameters and returns a new array with duplicates removed.
- **Hint**: Use two loops: one to pick each element and another to check if it's already in the result array.
