### **C Programming: Conditions and Loops**

#### Task 1: Check Even or Odd
-  Write a program that asks the user for an integer and checks if it's even or odd. Print "Number X is even" or "Number X is odd".
- **Hint**: Use an `if-else` statement to check if the number is divisible by 2.

#### Task 2: Simple Password Checker
-  Write a program that asks the user for a password (hardcoded as `1234`). If the input matches, print "Access Granted", otherwise print "Access Denied".
- **Hint**: Use an `if` statement to compare the input with the correct password.

#### Task 3: Grade Calculator
-  Write a program that takes a student's score (out of 100) and prints their grade based on the following rules:
  - 90 and above: "A"
  - 80-89: "B"
  - 70-79: "C"
  - 60-69: "D"
  - Below 60: "F"
- **Hint**: Use multiple `if-else` statements to check the ranges.

#### Task 4: Count Down to a Special Event
-  Write a program that counts down from 10 to 0 and prints "Happy New Year!" when it reaches 0.
- **Hint**: Use a `for` loop to handle the countdown.

#### Task 5: Print All Multiples of 3 Between 1 and 30
-  Write a program that prints all multiples of 3 between 1 and 30 (inclusive).
- **Hint**: Use a `for` loop and check if the current number is divisible by 3.

#### Task 6: Simple ATM Simulation
-  Write a program that asks for a withdrawal amount. The program should only allow withdrawals in multiples of 10 and should print the remaining balance after the transaction. If the amount is not valid (e.g., not a multiple of 10), print an error message.
- **Hint**: Use `if` conditions to check for valid input, and a simple loop if you want to allow multiple transactions.

Hereâ€™s the updated version of the last two tasks with your new requirements:

#### Task 7: Sum of Numbers Up to a Given Number
-  Write a program that asks the user to enter a positive number (e.g., 10). The program should then sum all the numbers from 1 up to that number and print the result. For example, if the user enters 10, the output should be "The sum of numbers from 1 to 10 is 55."
- **Hint**: Use a `for` loop to calculate the sum.

#### Task 8: Sum of Odd Numbers Up to a Given Number
-  Modify the program from Task 7 to only sum the odd numbers up to the given number. For example, if the user enters 10, the output should be "The sum of odd numbers from 1 to 10 is 25."
- **Hint**: Use a `for` loop and an `if` statement to check if a number is odd before adding it to the sum.

#### Task 9 (Challenge): Guess the Number Game
-  Create a guessing game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess it. After each guess, the program should tell the user if their guess was too high, too low, or correct. The game should continue until the correct number is guessed.
  
- **Key Requirements**:
  1. Generate a random number between 1 and 100 at the start.
  2. Keep asking for the user's guess until they find the correct number.
  3. After each guess, print whether the guess was "Too high", "Too low", or "Correct!".
  4. When the correct guess is made, print how many attempts it took the user.
  
- **Hint**: Use a `while` loop for continuous guessing and the `rand()` function from `stdlib.h` to generate a random number.
