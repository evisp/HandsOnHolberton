# Structs in C

### Problem Summary

In this project, you will learn to use structs in C by creating and managing a `Student` structure. They will define and implement functions to initialize, create, update, and display `Student` information. The program will be organized across three files: `student.h`, `student.c`, and `main.c`. Dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`) will be used to manage memory for student names.

## Tasks

### **Structure Definition**
- Define a `Student` structure that includes:
    - A `name` field for the student’s name, stored as a dynamically allocated string.
    - An `age` field as an integer.
    - An `average_grade` field as a floating-point number.

### **File Organization**

- Create three files for this project:
    - **`student.h`**: Header file containing the `Student` structure definition and function prototypes.
    - **`student.c`**: Implementation file with the functions defined in `student.h`.
    - **`main.c`**: Main program file for testing the `Student` struct and related functions.

### **Memory Management**

- Use `malloc` for dynamic memory allocation of student structures and `strdup` for copying the student’s name into dynamically allocated memory.
- Implement a function to free the dynamically allocated memory associated with a student.

### Functionality Requirements

Implement the following functions. Each function includes a suggested signature and a brief explanation.

#### **Initialization Function**

- Initializes an existing `Student` structure with given values for name, age, and average grade.

- **Signature**: 
```c
void init_student(Student *student, const char *name, int age, float average_grade);
```
- This function takes a pointer to a `Student` structure and assigns the provided name, age, and average grade values to it. `name` should be copied using `strdup` to dynamically allocate memory for the string.

- *Example*: If `init_student(&student, "John Doe", 20, 9.7)` is called, it will set the fields of `student` to have the name "John Doe" age 20, and an average grade of 9.7.

#### **Creation Function**

- Allocates memory for a new `Student`, initializes its fields, and returns a pointer to the allocated struct.

- **Signature**:
```c
Student *create_student(const char *name, int age, float average_grade);
```
- This function uses `malloc` to allocate memory for a `Student` structure, then calls `init_student` to initialize it. It returns a pointer to the newly created student.

- *Example*: `Student *s = create_student("John Doe", 21, 10.0);` will create a `Student` struct for "John Doe" with the specified age and grade and return a pointer to it.

#### **Display Function**
-Prints the details of a `Student` to the console.
- **Signature**:
```c
void print_student(const Student *student);
```
- This function takes a constant pointer to a `Student` and displays the `name`, `age`, and `average_grade`.


#### **Update Function**
-Updates the `average_grade` of an existing `Student`.
- **Signature**:
```c
void update_average_grade(Student *student, float new_grade);
```
- This function changes the `average_grade` of the `Student` structure to the new value provided.

- *Example*: `update_average_grade(s, 9.0);` updates `s`'s average grade to 9.0.

#### **Memory Freeing Function**
- Releases all dynamically allocated memory associated with a `Student`, including the name.
- **Signature**:
```c
void free_student(Student *student);
```
- This function first frees the memory allocated for the `name` (from `strdup`) and then frees the `Student` struct itself.



### **Main Program Functionality**
- In `main.c`:
    - Create an array of `Student` pointers, each initialized with sample data.
    - Use the functions to:
        - Display each student’s information.
        - Update the average grade of at least one student and display the updated information.
        - Free all dynamically allocated memory at the end of the program to avoid memory leaks.
