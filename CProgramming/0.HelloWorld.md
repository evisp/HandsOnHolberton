### **C Programming: Hello World Tasks for Beginners**

#### Task 1: Print Your First Message
-  Write a C program that prints "Hello, Holberton School!".
- **Hint**: Use `printf` to print the message. 

#### Task 2: Declare and Print a Variable
-  Declare an `int` variable named `age` with a value of 20, then print the message "I am 20 years old." using the `age` variable.
- **Hint**: Use placeholders in `printf` to include the variable in the output.

#### Task 3: Play with Different Data Types
-  Declare three variables: an `int` for age, a `float` for height (e.g., 1.75), and a `char` for grade (e.g., 'A'). Print the following message: "Age: 20, Height: 1.75, Grade: A".
- **Hint**: Use `%d` for `int`, `%f` for `float`, and `%c` for `char` in `printf`.

#### Task 4: Format Floating Point Numbers
-  Declare a `float` variable `pi` with the value `3.14159` and print it rounded to two decimal places (e.g., "Pi is approximately 3.14").
- **Hint**: Use `%.2f` to format the `float` in `printf`.

#### Task 5: Simple Math Operations
-  Declare two `int` variables `x` and `y` with values 10 and 5. Print their sum and difference in the format "x + y = z" and "x - y = z".
- **Hint**: You can calculate the sum and difference inside `printf` or assign it to another variable.

#### Task 6 (Challenge): Build a Simple Calculator Output
- Display a simple message, say `My First Calculator`
- In `main`, declare two `int` variables `x` and `y` with values of your choice. 
- Calculate then the sum, difference, product, and quotient of those two variables. Store each result in a different variable
- Display the result of each operation in a format similar to
```
8 + 4 = 12
8 - 4 = 4
8 * 4 = 32
8 / 4 = 2
```
- Display another message at the end. For example `It is great to be a programmer`
