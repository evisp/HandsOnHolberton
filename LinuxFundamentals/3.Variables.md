### **Shell Environment Variables and Aliases**

#### Task 1: View Environment Variables
- Display all the environment variables currently set in your shell.

#### Task 2: Check a Specific Environment Variable
- Use a command to print the value of the `PATH` environment variable.

#### Task 3: Set a Local Variable
- Set a variable named `SCHOOL` with the value "Holberton" and verify that it's set.

#### Task 4: Export a Variable
- Export the `SCHOOL` variable so it becomes an environment variable, and check if it persists in subprocesses.

#### Task 5: Unset a Variable
- Unset the `SCHOOL` environment variable, and ensure that it's no longer available.

#### Task 6: Create an Alias for a Common Command
- Create an alias called `ll` for `ls -l`, and verify that the alias works by listing the current directory in long format.

#### Task 7: Remove an Alias
- Remove the alias `ll` and confirm that it's no longer available.

#### Task 8: Use a File to Set Variables and Aliases
- Create a file named `holberton_env.sh` that exports an environment variable `SCHOOL="Holberton"` and sets an alias `run_program="echo Running program..."`. Then, source the file and verify that both the environment variable and the alias are available.

#### Task 9: Use a Different Way to Source the File
- Use a different way to source `holberton_env.sh` by using the `.` command instead of `source`. Check that it works the same way.

#### Task 10: Print a Formatted Message
- Use `printf` to print the following message, replacing the placeholders with appropriate values: `"Welcome, [Your Name], to Holberton School!"`.
