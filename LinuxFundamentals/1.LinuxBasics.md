# Linux Basics

## Task 1: "Holberton Programming Environment" Directory Structure

**Objective**: Practice creating directories, subdirectories, and files.

1. **Create the main directory**:  
   - Create a directory named `Holberton_Programming`.
   - Inside `Holberton_Programming`, create three subdirectories: `Linux_Kernel`, `Shell_Scripting`, and `C_Projects`.

2. **In `Linux_Kernel`**:
   - Create two subdirectories: `Syscalls` and `Process_Management`.
   - Inside `Syscalls`, create an empty file named `system_call_info.txt`.
   - In `Process_Management`, create a file called `start_process.txt` and write “The journey starts here!” inside it.

3. **In `Shell_Scripting`**:
   - Create a directory named `Bash_Scripts`.
   - Inside `Bash_Scripts`, create three files: `linux_commands.txt`, `bash_aliases.txt`, and `utility_scripts.sh`.
   - Write a list of your favorite Linux commands into `linux_commands.txt`.

4. **In `C_Projects`**:
   - Create two subdirectories: `Source_Code` and `Build_Files`.
   - Inside `Source_Code`, create a hidden file called `.project_notes` with the text “Hidden gems of C programming.” 
   - Inside `Build_Files`, create an empty directory named `Executable_Artifacts`.

## Task 2: "Explore Holberton Programming Environment" Navigation

**Objective**: Practice navigating, listing, and manipulating files.

1. **Navigate**:  
   - Go to `Syscalls` and check the contents of `system_call_info.txt`.
   - Use relative paths to go from `Syscalls` to `Bash_Scripts` and then to `Executable_Artifacts` without leaving the terminal.

2. **Move Files**:  
   - Move the file `start_process.txt` from `Process_Management` to `Bash_Scripts`.
   - Rename `utility_scripts.sh` to `advanced_utilities.sh` in `Bash_Scripts`.

3. **Copy and List**:  
   - Copy `linux_commands.txt` to `Build_Files`.
   - Go to `Source_Code` and list all files, including hidden ones.

4. **Challenge**:  
   - Use one command to display the structure of `Holberton_Programming` (showing directories and files) from the main directory.

## Task 3: "Clean Up Holberton Programming Environment"

**Objective**: Practice file deletion and clean up.

1. **Delete Empty Directories**:  
   - Delete the empty directory `Executable_Artifacts`.

2. **Remove Files**:  
   - Remove the file `bash_aliases.txt` from `Bash_Scripts`.

3. **Final Clean-Up**:  
   - Navigate to `Holberton_Programming` and remove all subdirectories of `C_Projects`.
