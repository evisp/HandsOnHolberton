# Linux Basics

## Task 1: "Holberton World" Directory Structure

**Objective**: Practice creating directories, subdirectories, and files.

1. **Create the main directory**:  
   - Create a directory named `Holberton_World`.
   - Inside `Holberton_World`, create three subdirectories: `Kernel_Land`, `Shellville`, and `Filesystem_Forest`.

2. **In `Kernel_Land`**:
   - Create two subdirectories: `Syscalls_Peak` and `Process_Plane`.
   - Inside `Syscalls_Peak`, create an empty file named `magic_number.txt`
   - In `Process_Plane`, create a file called `init_program.txt` and write “The journey starts here!” inside it.

3. **In `Shellville`**:
   - Create a directory named `Bash_Boulevard`.
   - Inside `Bash_Boulevard`, create three files: `commands.txt`, `aliases.txt`, and `scripts.sh`.
   - Write a list of your favorite Linux commands into `commands.txt`

4. **In `Filesystem_Forest`**:
   - Create two subdirectories: `Inode_Cave` and `Pathway_River`.
   - Inside `Inode_Cave`, create a hidden file called `.treasure` with the text “Hidden gems of Linux.”
   - Inside `Pathway_River`, create an empty directory named `Mountpoint_Island`.


## Task 2: "Explore Holberton World" Navigation

**Objective**: Practice navigating, listing, and manipulating files.

1. **Navigate**:  
   - Go to `Syscalls_Peak` and check the contents of `magic_number.txt`.
   - Use relative paths to go from `Syscalls_Peak` to `Bash_Boulevard` and then to `Mountpoint_Island` without leaving the terminal.

2. **Move Files**:  
   - Move the file `init_program.txt` from `Process_Plane` to `Bash_Boulevard`.
   - Rename `scripts.sh` to `super_scripts.sh` in `Bash_Boulevard`.

3. **Copy and List**:  
   - Copy `commands.txt` to `Pathway_River`.
   - Go to `Inode_Cave` and list all files, including hidden ones.

4. **Challenge**:  
   - Use one command to display the structure of `Holberton_World` (showing directories and files) from the main directory.


## Task 3: "Clean Up Holberton World"

**Objective**: Practice file deletion and clean up.

1. **Delete Empty Directories**:  
   - Delete the empty directory `Mountpoint_Island`.

2. **Remove Files**:  
   - Remove the file `aliases.txt` from `Bash_Boulevard`.

3. **Final Clean-Up**:  
   - Navigate to `Holberton_World` and remove all subdirectories of `Filesystem_Forest`.
