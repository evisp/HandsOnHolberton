# SQL Beginner Tasks

## Task Overview
In this exercise, you will create a database to manage users and their assigned tasks. You will:
1. Create a database.
2. Define and create tables.
3. Insert sample data.
4. Perform various SQL queries.


For each task create a separate `.sql` file containing the necessary SQL commands.

---

## 1. Create a Database
**File:** `01_create_database.sql`

- Create a database named `task_management`.

---

## 2. Create Tables
**File:** `02_create_tables.sql`

- Create a table `users` with the following columns:
  - `id` (Primary Key, Auto Increment)
  - `name` (String, Not Null)
  - `email` (Unique, Not Null)
  - `created_at` (Timestamp, Default Current Time)
- Create a table `tasks` with the following columns:
  - `id` (Primary Key, Auto Increment)
  - `user_id` (Foreign Key referencing `users.id`)
  - `description` (Text, Not Null)
  - `status` (Can be 'pending' or 'completed', Default 'pending')
  - `due_date` (Date)

## 3. Insert Sample Data
**File:** `03_insert_data.sql`

- Insert at least five users into the `users` table.
- Insert at least twenty tasks into the `tasks` table, ensuring they belong to the users.

---

## 4. Perform Queries
### a) Retrieve All Users
**File:** `04_queries.sql`
- Write a query to retrieve all users.
- Write a query to display all tasks along with user names.
- Write a query to retrieve all tasks that are still pending.
- Write a query to find all tasks that are due within the next 7 days.
- Write a query to count the number of tasks assigned to each user.
- Write a query to update a specific task and mark it as completed.
- Write a query to delete a user and ensure all their tasks are also removed.
- Write a query to display completed tasks along with the user names who completed them
- Write a query to find the user with the most assigned tasks.
- Write a query to find all users who do not have any assigned tasks
- Write a query to list all tasks assigned after a specific date, along with the user information.
- Write a query to display overdue tasks (past due date) along with the user names assigned to them.
