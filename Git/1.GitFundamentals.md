# Git Fundamentals

## Task 1: "Set Up Your Git Playground"

**Objective**: Set up a Git repository and practice basic Git commands.

1. **Create a new GitHub repository**:
   - Name it something fun, like `holberton_git_playground`. Do **not** add any files yet.

2. **Clone it to your computer**:
   - In the terminal, clone the repository

3. **Create a file and commit it**:
   - In your new `holberton_git_playground` directory, create a file called `README.md`.
   - Write a fun message inside, like “Welcome to my Git playground!”
   - Add and commit the file. 

4. **Push to GitHub**:
   - Push your changes to the main branch

## Task 2: "Branching Out Like a Tree"

**Objective**: Learn how to create branches and switch between them.

1. **Create a new branch**:
   - From the main branch, create a new branch called `add-linux-notes`:


2. **Add a new file**:
   - On the `add-linux-notes` branch, create a file called `linux_cheatsheet.txt` and add 3-5 cool Linux commands.
   - Stage, commit, and push:

3. **Switch back to main**:
   - Switch back to the `main` branch and see how the new file doesn’t exist there (yet)

## Task 3: "Branch Hopping and Merging"

**Objective**: Practice switching branches and merging without pull requests.

1. **Switch back to `add-linux-notes`**:
   - Switch back to the `add-linux-notes` branch:

2. **Merge `add-linux-notes` into `main`**:
   - Switch to the `main` branch and merge `add-linux-notes`

3. **Clean up**:
   - Delete the `add-linux-notes` branch after merging:


## Task 4: "Experiment with New Features"

**Objective**: Create multiple branches, experiment with features, and merge them back.

1. **Create a new branch**:
   - Create a branch called `add-fun-facts`:


2. **Add a new file**:
   - Create a file called `fun_facts.txt` and write 3 fun facts about programming or Linux.
   - Stage, commit, and push



5. **Merge `add-fun-facts` into `main`**:



## Task 5: "Git Detective – Check Your History"

**Objective**: Explore the history of your Git project.

1. **View commit history**:
   - Run the following command to see the log of all your commits:
     ```bash
     git log --oneline
     ```

2. **Check a previous version**:
   - Identify a commit from the log and check out that specific commit:
     ```bash
     git checkout <commit_hash>
     ```

3. **Return to the latest version**:
   - After viewing an old commit, go back to the latest version:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     ```
