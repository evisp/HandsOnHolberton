# Git Fundamentals


These tasks are designed to help you learn Git fundamentals through practical experience. The goals include:

- Creating a Git repository with organized folders and files.
- Staging, committing, and pushing changes to a remote repository.
- Making modifications to existing files and adding new ones, then repeating the process.
- Creating and switching branches to implement new features before merging them back into the main branch.
- Collaborating with others by adding a collaborator, allowing them to make changes, and pulling their updates into your local repository.


### Task 1: Create a Repository
1. **Create a new Git repository**:
   - Create a repository called `HolbertonCode`. You may create it through GitHub and then clone it to your local machine

2. **Create folders and files**:
   - Create three folders called `LinuxScripts`, `C` and `Web`.
   - In `LinuxScripts`, create two files:
      - File `hello_world.sh` with the content 
      ```bash
      echo "#!/bin/bash"
      echo "Hello World"
      ```
      - File `list_all.sh` with the content 
      ```bash
      echo "#!/bin/bash"
      ls -l
      ```
   - In `C`, create one C file called `hello_c.c` with the content
      ```c
         #include <stdio.h>
         int main() 
         {
            printf("Hello World!");
            return(0);
         }
      ```
   - In `Web`, create an HTML file called `home.html` with the content
   ```html
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html lang="en">
      <head>
         <meta charset="UTF-8">
         <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
         <title>Hello HTML</title>
      </head>
      <body>
         <h1>Hello HTML</h1>
      </body>
      </html>

   ```
### Task 2: Add, Commit, and Push
1. Make sure to stage (**add**) your changes, commit them and push to the remote repository 

### Task 3: Make Changes and Repeat
1. **Make changes to existing files**:
   - Open `LinuxScripts/hello_world.sh` and modify the script to add another line (e.g.,  `This script does more now!`).
   - Add a new file in `C` called `code.c` with this content   
   ```c 
      #include <stdio.h>
      int main() {
         printf("I love C programming\n");
         return 0;
      }
   ```

2. **Stage and commit your changes** and **push** them to the remote repository

### Task 4: Create and Switch to a New Branch
1. **Create a new branch** called `feature-enhancements`and switch to this branch. 

2. **Make changes in the new branch**:
   - Create a new file in `Web` called `feature.html` with the content `This is a new paragraph added in the feature branch`.

3. **Stage and commit your changes**:
   - Execute the necessary commands to add, commit, and push your changes to the branch `feature-enhancements`


4. **Merge back to the main branch**:
   - Switch back to the main branch
   - Merge the changes

### Task 5: Collaborate with Another User
1. **Add a collaborator**:
   - Go to your GitHub repository settings and add another user as a collaborator.

2. **Have the collaborator make changes**:
   - Once they accept the invitation, they can clone the repository to their local machine.
   - They can create a new file in `Web` called `collaborator_notes.txt` with teh content `Here are collaborator's notes`.
   - They should stage, commit, and push their changes
   
3. **Pull changes from the collaborator**:
   - Go back to your local repository.
   - Run `git pull origin main` to fetch and merge the collaborator’s changes.
