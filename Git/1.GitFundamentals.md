# Git Fundamentals


These tasks are designed to help you learn Git fundamentals through practical experience. The goals include:

- Creating a Git repository with organized folders and files.
- Staging, committing, and pushing changes to a remote repository.
- Making modifications to existing files and adding new ones, then repeating the process.
- Creating and switching branches to implement new features before merging them back into the main branch.
- Collaborating with others by adding a collaborator, allowing them to make changes, and pulling their updates into your local repository.


### Task 1: Create a Repository
1. **Create a new Git repository**:
   - Create a repository called `HolbertonCode`. You may create it through GitHub and then clone it to your local machine

2. **Create folders and files**:
   - Create three folders called `LinuxScripts`, `C` and `Web`.
   - In `LinuxScripts`, create two files:
      - File `hello_world.sh` with the content 
      ```bash
      echo "#!/bin/bash"
      echo "Hello World"
      ```
      - File `list_all.sh` with the content 
      ```bash
      echo "#!/bin/bash"
      ls -l
      ```
   - In `C`, create one C file called `hello_c.c` with the content
      ```c
         #include <stdio.h>
         int main() 
         {
            printf("Hello World!");
            return(0);
         }
      ```
   - In `Web`, create an HTML file called `home.html` with the content
   ```html5
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html lang="en">
      <head>
         <meta charset="UTF-8">
         <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
         <title>Hello HTML</title>
      </head>
      <body>
         <h1>Hello HTML</h1>
      </body>
      </html>

   ```
### Task 2: Add, Commit, and Push
1. **Stage your changes**:
   - Run `git add .` to stage all changes (folders and files).

2. **Commit your changes**:
   - Run `git commit -m "Initial commit with LinuxScripts, C, and Web folders and files"`.

3. **Push to a remote repository**:
   - Create a new repository on GitHub named "HolbertonCode".
   - Link your local repository to the remote one:
     - `git remote add origin <remote-repo-URL>`.
   - Push your changes:
     - `git push -u origin main`.

### Task 3: Make Changes and Repeat
1. **Make changes to existing files**:
   - Open `LinuxScripts/script1.sh` and modify the script to add another line (e.g., `echo "This script does more now!"`).
   - Add a new file in `C`: `echo "int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }" > C/functions.c`.

2. **Stage and commit your changes**:
   - Run `git add .` to stage the modified and new files.
   - Run `git commit -m "Updated script1.sh and added functions.c in C folder"`.

3. **Push your changes**:
   - Run `git push`.

### Task 4: Create and Switch to a New Branch
1. **Create a new branch**:
   - Run `git checkout -b feature-enhancements` to create and switch to a new branch called "feature-enhancements".

2. **Make changes in the new branch**:
   - Create a new file in `Web`: `echo "<p>This is a new paragraph added in the feature branch.</p>" > Web/feature.html`.

3. **Stage and commit your changes**:
   - Run `git add .`.
   - Run `git commit -m "Added feature.html in feature-enhancements branch"`.

4. **Merge back to the main branch**:
   - Switch back to the main branch: `git checkout main`.
   - Merge the changes: `git merge feature-enhancements`.

### Task 5: Collaborate with Another User
1. **Add a collaborator**:
   - Go to your GitHub repository settings and add another user as a collaborator.

2. **Have the collaborator make changes**:
   - Once they accept the invitation, they can clone the repository to their local machine.
   - They can create a new file: `echo "Collaborator's notes" > Web/collaborator_notes.txt`.
   - They will stage, commit, and push their changes:
     - `git add .`, `git commit -m "Added collaborator's notes"`, `git push`.

3. **Pull changes from the collaborator**:
   - Go back to your local repository.
   - Run `git pull origin main` to fetch and merge the collaborator’s changes.
