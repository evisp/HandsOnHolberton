# Debugging Challenges: Loops, Conditions, Functions, and Strings  

 Each challenge is designed to help you think critically and improve your debugging skills. Below are a series of tasks in the areas of loops, conditions, functions, and strings.  

---

## Loops  

### Task 1: Print Even Numbers  
**Goal:** Fix the code to print all even numbers from 1 to 10.  
**Faulty Code:**  
```python
for i in range(1, 10):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i)
    else:
        print("Odd")
```

### Task 2: Sum of Multiples  
**Goal:** Correct the code to calculate the sum of all numbers divisible by 3 or 5 below 20.  
**Faulty Code:**  
```python
def sum_multiples():
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, 20):
        if i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0:
            total = i
    return total
```

## Conditions  

### Task 3: Leap Year Checker  
**Goal:** Fix the code to correctly identify leap years.  
**Faulty Code:**  
```python
def is_leap_year(year):
    if year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 != 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

### Task 4: Grade Evaluator  
**Goal:** Debug the code to return the correct letter grade based on the score.  
**Faulty Code:**  
```python
def get_grade(score):
    if score >= 90:
        return "A"
    elif score >= 80:
        return "B"
    elif score >= 70:
        return "C"
    elif score >= 60:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"
```

## Functions  

### Task 5: Power Calculator  
**Goal:** Fix the function to return `base` raised to the power of `exponent`.  
**Faulty Code:**  
```python
def power(base, exponent):
    result = 1
    for i in range(exponent):
        result *= base
    return base
```

---

### Task 6: Fibonacci Sequence  
**Goal:** Correct the function to return a list of the first `n` Fibonacci numbers.  
**Faulty Code:**  
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    sequence = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        sequence[i] = sequence[i - 1] + sequence[i - 2]
    return sequence
```

---

## Strings  

### Task 7: Reverse Words  
**Goal:** Fix the function to reverse the order of words in a string.  
**Faulty Code:**  
```python
def reverse_words(sentence):
    words = sentence.split(" ")
    return " ".join(words.reverse())
```

---

### Task 8: Palindrome Checker  
**Goal:** Debug the function to correctly check if a string is a palindrome.  
**Faulty Code:**  
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    s = s.lower().replace(" ", "")
    if s == s[::-1]:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

## How to Use  
1. Review each challenge and its faulty code.  
2. Debug the code to ensure it meets the described goal.  
3. Test your solutions with various inputs.  

Good luck, and enjoy the debugging journey! ðŸš€
