# Debugging Challenges: Data Structures in Python  

Each challenge is designed to help you think critically and improve your debugging skills with data structures. Below are a series of tasks focused on lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples.  

---

## Lists  

### Task 1: Remove Duplicates  
**Goal:** Fix the function to remove duplicates from a list and return the unique elements.  
**Faulty Code:**  
```python
def remove_duplicates(lst):
    for item in lst:
        if item in unique:
            unique.append(item)
    return lst
```

### Task 2: Find Maximum Element  
**Goal:** Correct the function to find and return the maximum element in a list.  
**Faulty Code:**  
```python
def find_maximum(lst):
    max_value = 0
    for num in lst:
        if num < max_value:
            max_value = num
    return num
```

---

## Dictionaries  

### Task 3: Count Occurrences  
**Goal:** Fix the function to count the occurrences of each element in a list and store them in a dictionary.  
**Faulty Code:**  
```python
def count_occurrences(lst):
    counts = {}
    for item in lst:
        counts[item] =+ 1
    return counts
```

---

### Task 4: Merge Dictionaries  
**Goal:** Correct the function to merge two dictionaries. If a key exists in both, add their values.  
**Faulty Code:**  
```python
def merge_dicts(dict1, dict2):
    for key in dict2:
        if key in dict1:
            dict1[key] += dict2[key]
    return dict1
```

---

## Sets  

### Task 5: Find Common Elements  
**Goal:** Fix the function to return the common elements between two sets.  
**Faulty Code:**  
```python
def common_elements(set1, set2):
    return set1 + set2
```

---

### Task 6: Unique Elements  
**Goal:** Correct the function to return a set containing only unique elements from a list.  
**Faulty Code:**  
```python
def unique_elements(lst):
    unique_set = {}
    for item in lst:
        unique_set.add(item)
    return lst
```

---

## Tuples  

### Task 7: Swap Tuple Values  
**Goal:** Fix the function to swap the values of a given tuple.  
**Faulty Code:**  
```python
def swap_tuple(t):
    t[0], t[1] == t[1], t[0]
    return t
```

---

### Task 8: Tuple to Dictionary  
**Goal:** Correct the function to convert a list of tuples into a dictionary. The first element should be the key, the second the value.  
**Faulty Code:**  
```python
def tuple_to_dict(lst):
    result = []
    for key, value in lst:
        result[key] = value
```

## How to Use  
1. Review each challenge and its faulty code.  
2. Debug the code to ensure it meets the described goal.  
3. Test your solutions with various inputs.  

Good luck, and enjoy the debugging journey! ðŸš€
