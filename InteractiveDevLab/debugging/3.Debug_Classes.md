# Debugging Challenges: Data Structures in Python  

Each challenge is designed to help you think critically and improve your debugging skills with data structures. Below are a series of tasks focused on essential aspects of classes.

---

## Student Class

The following Python class represents a Student, but it contains multiple logical and structural errors.  Your challenge is to identify and fix all logical errors in this class. Some errors are more obvious than others, but all of them affect how the class behaves.
- ✅ Fix the errors
- ✅ Test the class by creating a Student object and calling its methods

```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.__name = name
        self.__age = age
        self.__grades = None

    def name(self):
        return self.name  

    def name(self, value):
        self._name = name  
    
    @property
    def age(self):
        self.__age = age

    @age.setter
    def age(self):
        return self.__age
    
    @property
    def grades(self):
        return self._grades.copy() 

    def add_grade(self, grade):
        grades.append(grade)  
    
    def average_grade(self):
        return  len(self.grades) / sum(self.grades)
    
    def to_dict(self):
        print(f"name: {self.__name} age: {self.__age} grades: {self.__grades}")

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Student({self._name}, {self._age}, {self.grades})"  

john_doe = Student()
print(john_doe)
```

## Account Class
The following class represents a bank account with methods for deposits, withdrawals, and balance checks. However, it contains several logical issues. **Your task is to identify and to fix them**

```python
class Account:
    def __init__(self, owner):
        self.__owner = owner
        self.__balance = balance  

    @property
    def owner(self):
        return self.owner  

    @property
    def balance(self):
        return balance 

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount  

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        self.balance -= amount   

    def transfer(self, target_account, amount):
        self.withdraw(amount)
        target_account.deposit(amount)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Account Owner: {self.owner}, Balance: ${self.balance}"  
    
acc1 = Account("Alice", 500)
acc2 = Account("Bob")

acc1.transfer(acc2, 200) 
print(acc1)
print(acc2)
```

## Employee Class
The following class represents an `Employee` with details like name, salary, and job position. However, it contains several logical errors related to instance variables, method logic, and property handling. **Your job is to identify and fix them**. 

```python
class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name, salary, position):
        self.__name = name
        self.__salary = salary
        self.__position = position
        self.__bonus = 0  

    @property
    def name(self):
        return name  

    @property
    def salary(self):
        return salary   

    @salary.setter
    def salary(self, amount):
        salary = amount 

    @property
    def position(self):
        return self.position   

    def position(self, new_position):
        self.position = new_position 

    def apply_bonus(self, percentage):
        self.__bonus = self.salary * percentage 

    def annual_salary(self):
        return self.salary * 12 + self.bonus  

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Employee {self.name} works as {self.position} with a salary of ${self.salary}"  
    
emp = Employee("John Doe", 50000, "Developer")
emp.salary = -10000 
emp.apply_bonus(10)  
print(emp.annual_salary()) 
print(emp)

```
