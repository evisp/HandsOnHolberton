# Python Programming Tasks

This collection of tasks will help you refine your skills in Python through various coding challenges, emphasizing loops, conditions, functions, and string manipulation. Each task presents a problem and asks you to write a solution in Python. In some cases, you’ll also be asked to refactor and optimize C-style solutions into more concise, Pythonic code.

## Tasks:

### **Task 1: Print Even Numbers**
**Goal**: Write a program that prints all even numbers between 1 and 100.

**Solution Approach (C-Style)**:
```python
def print_even_numbers():
    for i in range(1, 101):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            print(i)
```

**Challenge**: Refactor the solution to make it more concise using list comprehensions or other Python features.

### **Task 2: Sum of Digits**
**Goal**: Write a function that takes a number and returns the sum of its digits.

**Solution Approach (C-Style)**:
```python
def sum_of_digits(n):
    total = 0
    while n > 0:
        total += n % 10
        n = n // 10
    return total
```

**Challenge**: Can you find a more Pythonic way to solve this problem?

### **Task 3: Check Palindrome**
**Goal**: Write a function that checks whether a string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).

**Solution Approach (C-Style)**:
```python
def is_palindrome(word):
    length = len(word)
    for i in range(length // 2):
        if word[i] != word[length - 1 - i]:
            return False
    return True
```

**Challenge**: Refactor the function to make it shorter and more readable, using Python’s string slicing or other features.

### **Task 4: Find Prime Numbers**
**Goal**: Write a function that returns a list of prime numbers up to `n`.

**Solution Approach (C-Style)**:
```python
def find_primes(n):
    primes = []
    for num in range(2, n + 1):
        is_prime = True
        for i in range(2, num):
            if num % i == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            primes.append(num)
    return primes
```

**Challenge**: Can you refactor this solution to reduce unnecessary checks or simplify it?

### **Task 5: Reverse Words in a Sentence**
**Goal**: Write a function that takes a sentence and reverses the order of words.

**Solution Approach (C-Style)**:
```python
def reverse_words(sentence):
    words = sentence.split(" ")
    reversed_sentence = ""
    for i in range(len(words) - 1, -1, -1):
        reversed_sentence += words[i] + " "
    return reversed_sentence.strip()
```

**Challenge**: Refactor the solution to use fewer lines of code, focusing on string manipulation and loops.

---

### **Task 6: Multiplication Table**
**Goal**: Write a program that prints the multiplication table from 1 to 10.

**Solution Approach (C-Style)**:
```python
def print_multiplication_table():
    for i in range(1, 11):
        for j in range(1, 11):
            print(f"{i} x {j} = {i * j}")
```

**Challenge**: Can you modify this code to print the table in a cleaner format (like a grid) without using extra functions?

---

### **Task 7: Count Vowels**
**Goal**: Write a function that counts the number of vowels in a string.

**Solution Approach (C-Style)**:
```python
def count_vowels(s):
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char in vowels:
            count += 1
    return count
```

**Challenge**: Try to refactor the solution using more concise Python features such as list comprehensions or `sum()`.

---

### **Task 8: Factorial Calculation**
**Goal**: Write a function that calculates the factorial of a number using a loop.

**Solution Approach (C-Style)**:
```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

**Challenge**: Try to make this solution more compact and see if you can eliminate the loop entirely.

---

### **Task 9: Fibonacci Sequence**
**Goal**: Write a function that prints the first `n` Fibonacci numbers without using lists or arrays.

**Solution Approach (C-Style)**:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for i in range(n):
        print(a, end=" ")
        a, b = b, a + b
```

**Challenge**: Can you change this solution to return a string of Fibonacci numbers (space-separated) instead of printing them?
