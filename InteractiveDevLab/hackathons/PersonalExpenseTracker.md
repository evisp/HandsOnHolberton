# Mini Hackathon: Personal Expense Tracker

## Goals and Objectives
The goal of this hackathon is to help you think like software engineers by designing a simple **Personal Expense Tracker**. The objectives are:

- Understand the process of identifying inputs, outputs, and key functionalities of software.
- Learn how to structure and present ideas clearly.
- Work as a team to develop a creative solution to a common problem.
- Focus on thinking in terms of user needs, simplicity, and functionality rather than writing code.

## Hackathon Phases

### Phase 1: Brainstorming and Planning (1 hour)
**Objective:** Identify what your software will do, how users will interact with it, and what makes your solution unique.

**Deliverables:**
- A list of inputs and outputs for the software.
- A prioritized list of features (what is essential vs. what is nice to have).
- A clear description of how users will interact with your software.

**Guidelines:**
- Start by asking, *"What problem are we solving?"
- Think about the simplest way users can:
  - Add an expense.
  - View their spending.
  - Get insights (e.g., totals, trends).
- Discuss what makes your idea unique (e.g., mobile-friendly, shared expenses, visual analytics).

**Hints:**
- Think about common challenges in tracking expenses: forgetting to log them, complex interfaces, or lack of insights.
- Imagine the user’s daily routine. How can your tool fit into their life?

### Phase 2: Designing the Prototype (2 hours)
**Objective:** Create a visual representation of your solution and outline how it will work.

**Deliverables:**
- A simple diagram or flowchart showing how the software works.
- Mockups of the user interface (hand-drawn or digital).
- A description of the key functionalities and how they interact.

**Guidelines:**
- Design the following screens:
  - **Home Screen:** What does the user see first?
  - **Add Expense Screen:** How do users input an expense?
  - **Analytics Screen:** How do users view their spending?
- Outline the data flow:
  - What happens when users add an expense?
  - Where is the data stored?
  - How is the data processed for analytics?
- Focus on simplicity and usability.

**Hints:**
- Use sticky notes or paper to create mockups if you don’t want to use digital tools.
- Think about how users can save time (e.g., pre-filled categories, default dates).
- Explore fun ideas, like adding emojis for categories or simple graphs for trends.

### Phase 3: Presentation (1 hour)
**Objective:** Present your solution clearly and persuasively to the other teams.

**Deliverables:**
- A short (10-minute) presentation explaining:
  - The problem you are solving.
  - Your solution and what makes it unique.
  - Key features and how they work.
  - A walk-through of your mockups or diagrams.
- Be prepared to answer questions from the judges.

**Guidelines:**
- Structure your presentation:
  - Start with the problem (why tracking expenses is important).
  - Explain your unique idea and features.
  - Walk through how users interact with your software.
- Use visuals (mockups, diagrams) to make your ideas clear.
- Be confident and explain why your solution is the best!

**Hints:**
- Practice explaining your idea in simple terms.
- Use *"what if"* questions to think of potential improvements or challenges.
- Keep your presentation concise and focused on key points.

## Evaluation Criteria
Your solution will be judged on:

1. **Understanding of Inputs/Outputs:** Are they clear and relevant?
2. **Creativity and Innovation:** How unique and practical is your idea?
3. **User Experience:** Is the solution simple and intuitive?
4. **Feasibility:** Can your design be implemented realistically?
5. **Presentation Quality:** Is the idea communicated clearly and effectively?
